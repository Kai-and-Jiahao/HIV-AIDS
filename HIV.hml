<h3 id="1">what is HIV?</h3>
<p>HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus 
that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, if 
not treated. Unlike some other viruses, the human body can’t get 
rid of HIV completely, even with treatment. So once you get HIV, 
you have it for life.</p>

<h3 id="2">What does it do?</h3>
<p>HIV attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the CD4 cells 
(T cells), which help the immune system fight off infections. 
Untreated, HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells (T cells) in the 
body, making the person more likely to get other infections or 
infection-related cancers. Over time, HIV can destroy so many 
of these cells that the body can’t fight off infections and 
disease. These opportunistic infections or cancers take advantage 
of a very weak immune system and signal that the person has AIDS, 
the last stage of HIV infection.</p>

<h3 id="3">HIV/AIDS facts</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Over 95% of people living with HIV live in developing countries</li>
    <li>In Africa, the average life expectancy is 47 years. Without AIDS it would be 62</li>
    <li>In Uganda, girls ages 15-24 are 4 times more likely to contract HIV than boys</li>
    <li>Most people living with the virus can't access treatment</li>
    <li>Nearly a quarter of people living with HIV/AIDS are unaware thay have it</li>
    <li>Over 1 million people in the US have HIV/AIDS, 46% are African American</li>
    <li>Over 12 million children in Africa have been orphaned due to AIDS</li>
    <li>There is no cure for HIV/AIDS; antiretroviral drugs can only improve the strengthen the patient's immune system, not cure the disease</li>
    <li>Since the begginningvof the epidemic there has been 70 million deaths world wide</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="4">HIV/AIDS origin</h3>
<p>Scientists identified a type of chimpanzee in West Africa as 
the source of HIV infection in humans. They believe that the 
chimpanzee version of the immunodeficiency virus (called simian 
immunodeficiency virus or SIV) most likely was transmitted to 
humans and mutated into HIV when humans hunted these chimpanzees 
for meat and came into contact with their infected blood.<br><br> Over 
decades, the virus slowly spread across Africa and later into 
other parts of the world. The earliest known case of infection 
with HIV-1 in a human was detected in a blood sample collected 
in 1959 from a man in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
(How he became infected is not known.) Genetic analysis of this 
blood sample suggested that HIV-1 may have stemmed from a single 
virus in the late 1940s or early 1950s. We know that the virus 
has existed in the United States since at least the mid to late 
1970s. These were conditions not usually found in people with 
healthy immune systems. In 1982 public health officials began to 
use the term "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome," or AIDS, to 
describe the occurrences of opportunistic infections, Kaposi's 
sarcoma (a kind of cancer), and  Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 
in previously healthy people. Formal tracking (surveillance) of AIDS
cases began that year in the United States. In 1983, scientists 
discovered the virus that causes AIDS.<br><br>The virus was at first named 
HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type 
III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus) by an international scientific 
committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency
 virus). For many years scientists theorized as to the origins of HIV 
and how it appeared in the human population, most believing that HIV 
originated in other primates. Then in 1999, an international team of 
researchers reported that they had discovered the origins of HIV-1, 
the predominant strain of HIV in the developed world. A subspecies 
of chimpanzees native to west equatorial Africa had been identified 
as the original source of the virus. The researchers believe that 
HIV-1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became 
exposed to infected blood.</p>

<h3 id="5">Symptoms of HIV/AIDS</h3>
<p>If you have HIV/AIDS...</p>
<ul>
	<li>You'll have pain in the abdomen occured while swallowing</li>
	<li>Your cough can be dry</li>
	<li>Your whole body can have fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, malaise, night sweats, or sweating</li>
	<li>Yo'll have nausea, persistent diarrhoea, vomiting, or watery diarrhoea</li>
	<li>Your mouth can have ulcers or white tongue</li>
	<li>Your groin hurts or it swelles</li>
	<li>You have difficult swallowing or soreness</li>
	<li>You can have opportunistic infections, headaches, oral thrush, pneumonia, red blotches, severe unintentional weight loss, skin rash, or swollen lymph nodes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6">Spread rates of HIV/AIDS</h3>
<p>1.8 million individuals world wide became newly infected with HIV 
in 2016. There is about 5 000 new infections per day. This includes 
160 000 children. Most of the children live in subsaharan Africa.</p>

<p>Since the start of the epidemic, an estimated 78 million people 
have become infected with HIV and 35 million people have died of 
AIDS-related illnesses. In 2016, 1 million people died of AIDS-related 
illnesses. </p>
	<img usemap="#map-4411" class="media-element file-article  lazyloaded" src="https://www.avert.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_scale_style_780/public/New%20infections%20since%202010_updated%20August2017_for%20website.png?itok=tH1yBVdV&amp;timestamp=1503493952" alt="New HIV infections since 2010 to 2017" title="">

<h3 id="7">Deaths</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people 
have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people 
have died of HIV. Globally, 36.7 million [30.8–42.9 million] people 
were living with HIV at the end of 2016. An estimated 0.8% 
[0.7-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, 
although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably 
between countries and regions. Sub-Saharan Africa remains most 
severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.2%) living 
with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living 
with HIV worldwide.<br>Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among 
people living with HIV, accounting for around one in three AIDS-related 
deaths. However, some progress had been made with tuberculosis-related 
deaths among people living with HIV declining by one third since 2007.</p>

<h3 id="8">Transmissions</h3>
<p>HIV is spread only in certain body fluids from a person infected 
with HIV. These fluids are blood semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal 
fluids, vaginal fluids and breast milk. In the US, HIV is spread 
mainly by having sex or sharing injection drug equipment, such as 
needles, with someone who has HIV.</p>

<h3 id="9">Was it cured or limitedly?</h3>
<p>No cure exists for AIDS, but strict adherence to antiretroviral 
regimens (ARVs) can dramatically slow the disease's progress as well 
as prevent secondary infections and complications.<br><br>Other ways of prevention include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use a new condom every time you have sex</li>
	<li>Consider the drug Truvade</li>
	<li>Tell your sexual partners if you have HIV</li>
	<li>Use a clean needle</li>
	<li>If your pregnant, get medical care right away</li>
	<li>Consider male circumcision</li>
</ul>
<p>HIV/AIDS is limmited by the fact that it can only be transmitted by bodily fluids</p>
